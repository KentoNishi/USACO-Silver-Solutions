# USACO Solutions
Solutions to algorithmic problems from [http://www.usaco.org](http://www.usaco.org).

## About
Solutions are written in C++, and the file is named ``main.cpp``. ``[name].in`` and ``[name].out`` contains the given example in the specific problem.
Extra files such as ``solution.[format]`` (the official solution) may be included in the problem directory.

## Other Information
* Directories with the naming scheme ``[name]-vX`` contain re-writes of the original solution.
* Many different versions of the same problem may exist.
* Each season's directory may contain problems from previous contests.
* The programs can be run with any C++ compiler, or with the following command:
  ```
  g++ main.cpp -g -o result;./result;
  ```
* In Visual Studio Code, the debug tasks are configured using GDB and g++ on WSL.
* Additional solutions are available in the [AlphaStar-CC34-Winter19](https://github.com/KentoNishi/AlphaStar-CC34-Winter19) repository.
